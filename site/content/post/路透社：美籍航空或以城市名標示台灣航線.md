為避免遭到中國大陸民航局懲罰，主要美籍航空公司與美國政府協調後達成共識，將網站上的台灣航線標示方式，變更為以目的地城市名稱標示。

中國大陸民航局在要求44家外籍航空網站上更改台灣航線名稱標示方式後，已有38家外籍航空更改標示，目前尚有6家外航由於技術原因仍在申請延期整改，最後截止日期是7月25日。

未更改網站上台灣標示方式的6家外航中，美籍航空有3家，分別是美國航空、聯合航空和達美航空。這3家航空公司稱，白宮私下要求他們不要理會中國大陸的要求，不要變更台灣的標示方式。

路透報導，這三家航空公司為避免整改期限屆滿後，因未變更台灣標示方式遭到中國大陸民航局懲罰，因此經過多次與美國政府協調後，雙方已達成協議，準備在大陸民航局期限屆滿前，將網站上的台灣名稱變更為航線目的地城市名稱，例如台北、高雄等。

U.S. airlines poised to change Taiwan references as China deadline looms: sources

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) – Major U.S. airlines are expected to change how their websites refer to Chinese-claimed Taiwan by Wednesday in an effort to avoid Chinese penalties, three sources said, after coordination between the carriers and the U.S. government.

Beijing has demanded that foreign firms, and airlines in particular, not refer to self-ruled Taiwan as non-Chinese territory on their websites, along with Hong Kong and Macau, a move described by the White House in May as “Orwellian nonsense”.

China set a final deadline of July 25 for the changes, and last month rejected U.S. requests for talks on the matter, adding to tension in relations already frayed by an escalating trade conflict.

Numerous non-U.S. airlines including Air Canada (AC.TO), Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and British Airways (ICAG.L) have already made changes to their websites, according to Reuters checks, after China’s Civil Aviation Administration sent a letter to 36 foreign air carriers earlier in the year.

The carriers were told to remove references on their websites and other materials that suggest Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are part of countries independent from China, but several U.S. operators, including Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and United Airlines (UAL.N), had requested more time to handle the matter.

A U.S. airline executive briefed on the issue told Reuters that the U.S. State Department notified China’s embassy in Washington late on Monday of the decision by U.S. airlines to only list certain destinations by city on both Chinese and English websites, and not refer to Taiwan as a jurisdiction.

Another source in Beijing said he was informed unofficially by the U.S. government that airlines would only use certain city names in the future.
